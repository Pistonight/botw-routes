# Start: Ketoh Wawai
- TODO:
    notes: Figure out the movement here. Want to get into the fog near Test of Wood. The WB to get to Tasho won't work in NS2
- Start Test of Wood:
    coord: [564.99, 264.83, -2160.65]
- WB to shrine (no chu)
- _Shrine::MaagHalan
- _Shrine::KeoRuug:
    notes: The fastest way is to SCW then slam attack into the mud. Otherwise slam attack into the mud
- Run + Ordinal WB
- Talk to Tasho, Backflip WB
- _Shrine::DaagChokah

- SCW + .dir(SE):
    notes: .link([Example]https://youtu.be/RFPrCRnR-R0) You can also WB through the fog, which is ~10s faster but more risky
