    comment: Radiant Shield
    notes: If you do shield surf SCW, use the forest dweller shield to get skew inside TOS (after you get it) to save some durability on the radiant shield as it's pretty tight.

- Light torches:
    notes:
    - The easy way to do this is to shoot the 2 closer
      from where you are coming from, then glide/move to the other side
      and shoot the other 2 with one shot
    - You could also land at one torch then shoot all from there, which is what I do
